  <p>This fall I will start as an Assistant Professor in the
    <a class="link" href="https://www.me.vt.edu/">Mechanical Engineering Department</a>
    at <a class="link" href="https://vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a>.
  My research interests lie at the intersection of human-robot interaction, machine learning, and control theory:
  I develop learning and control algorithms to personalize robots that collaborate with people.</p>
  <p>I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University.
  I received my doctoral degree in Mechanical Engineering from Rice University in 2018,
  and my bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Vanderbilt University in 2014.
  In 2017, I was also a visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
  <p><b>Prospective Students.</b> Thank you for your interest!
  I am looking for self-motivated students who are passionate about helping robots
  collaborate with people. Email me at: losey@vt.edu<p>
