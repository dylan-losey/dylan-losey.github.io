  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>As robots and artificial intelligence emerge, it is critical to ensure that these agents can co-exist and collaborate alongside humans.
    This course surveys recent literature to formalize interaction between robots and humans.
    We will cover diverse approaches to human-robot interaction, including learning from demonstration, Bayesian inference, intent detection, safe and optimal control, assistive autonomy, and user study design.
    Students will review and present existing literature, and conduct a research project.
  </p>

  <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
  Having successfully completed this course, the student will be able to:
  <ul>
    <li>Articulate the challenges of developing algorithms that facilitate human-robot interaction.</li>
    <li>Appraise and implement different methods to learn from human data.</li>
    <li>Use Bayesian inference to detect human intent and autonomously assist humans.</li>

  <h3>Office Hours</h3>
  <p>Wednesdays, 1:00-2:00pm and Fridays, 1:00-2:00pm<br />
  <i>On the weeks when homework is due</i>
  </p>
  <p>All students are invited to attend!
    You don't need to have a particular question &mdash;
    you’re welcome to just stop by for 5 minutes and introduce yourself,
    or talk about a recent lecture.
    I also encourage students to use the <i>Discussion</i> feature on Canvas,
    which I regularly check to answer questions.
    I will not respond to emails requesting help on a specific homework problem.
  </p>
</div>

<hr>
<div>
  <h3>Homework</h3>
  <p>There are 8 assigments, each of which is worth 4% of your final grade.
  Homework is due on Saturday by midnight (with one marked exception).
  Late assignments are not accepted, except when the student has an illness, emergency, or other pressing issue.
  If you need to ask for an extension due to one of these reasons do not hesitate to contact me.
  However, you must make your request before the homework deadline.</p>
</div>

<hr>
<div>
  <h3>Exams</h3>
  <p>The course has a midterm and a final exam that will be conducted in Lavery Hall 340.
  The midterm will occur during our regular class time.
  Both the midterm and the final are closed book,
  and you are not allowed to use online resources, tablets, or computers.
  However, you are encouraged to bring up to 2 sheets worth of notes
  (with writing on the front and back of each) for reference during the test.
  You may also bring a graphing calculator.
  </p>
</div>

<hr>
<div>
  <h3>Teamwork</h3>
  <p>Group discussion and collaborative work is encouraged
  on the homework, labs, and when studying for exams.
  However, you must submit your own assignment.
  All assignments submitted are considered graded work and are subject to the Honor Code.
  Students are not allowed to collaborate during the exams.</p>

  <h3>Services for Students with Disabilities</h3>
  <p>
  Every student in this course should have an equal opportunity to succeed.
  If you anticipate or experience academic barriers that may be due to disability,
  including but not limited to ADHD, chronic or temporary medical conditions, deaf or hard of hearing, learning disability, mental health, or vision impairment,
  please contact the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office (540-231-3788, ssd@vt.edu, or visit <a class="link" href="https://www.ssd.vt.edu/">www.ssd.vt.edu</a>).
  If you have an SSD accommodation letter, please email me as soon as possible so that I can accommodate your needs.
  I am happy to discuss your accommodations in a private meeting during office hours (or by appointment).
  </p>

<div>
  <h3>Honor Code</h3>
  <p>
  The Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to
  abide by states:</p>
  <p><i>“As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
  steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.”</i></p>
  <p>Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who
  has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining
  specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation.
  Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the
  requirements and expectations of the Honor Code. Academic integrity expectations are the same
  for online classes as they are for in person classes. All university policies and procedures apply
  in any Virginia Tech academic environment.
  For additional information about the Honor Code, please visit: <a class="link" href="https://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/">https://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/</a>
  </p>
</div>

<hr>
<div>
  <h3>Honor Code Pledge</h3>
  <p>The Virginia Tech honor code pledge for assignments is as follows:</p>
  <p><i>``I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this assignment.''</i></p>
  <p>
    The pledge is to be written out on all graded assignments at the university and signed by the student.
    The honor pledge represents both an expression of the student's support of the honor code and a commitment to uphold the academic standards at Virginia Tech.
  </p>
</div>

<hr>
<div>
  <h3>Academic Misconduct</h3>
  <p>
  If you have questions or are unclear about what constitutes academic
  misconduct on an assignment or exam, please speak with me.
  The normal sanction I will recommend for a violation of the Honor Code
  is an F* sanction as your final course grade. The
  F represents failure in the course, and * identifies a student
  who has failed to uphold the values of academic integrity at Virginia Tech.
