  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Robots will change the future of our society.
  Self-driving cars, assistive prostheses, and surgical robots are already here &mdash; what will be next?
  This course provides an introduction to modern robotics.
  You will learn the fundamental methods needed to represent, model, and control robotic arms.
  These tools will enable you to move forward in both research and industrial applications.</p>

  <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
  <p>Imagine that someone gives you a robot arm they have no idea how to use.
  By the end of this class, you will be able to:
  (a) express the position, orientation, and velocity of the robot,
  (b) build geometric and dynamic models of the robot, and
  (c) control the robot to follow a desired trajectory.

  <h3>Office Hours</h3>
  <p>Fridays, 1:00-2:00pm</p>
  <p>All students are invited to attend!
    You don't need to have a particular question &mdash;
    you’re welcome to just stop by for 5 minutes and introduce yourself,
    or talk about a recent lecture.
    I also encourage students to use the <i>Discussion</i> feature on Canvas,
    which I regularly check to answer questions.
    I will not respond to emails requesting help on a specific homework problem.
  </p>
</div>

<hr>
<div>
  <h3>Assignments</h3>
  <p>There are 8 assigments, each of which is worth 4% of your final grade.
  Homework is due on Saturday by midnight.
  Late assignments are not accepted, except when the student has an illness, emergency, or other pressing issue.
  If you need to ask for an extension due to one of these reasons do not hesitate to contact me.
  However, you must make your request before the homework deadline.</p>
</div>

<hr>
<div>
  <h3>Labs</h3>
  <p>There are 7 labs which are worth 18% of your final grade in total.
  Labs take place in Randolph Hall, Room 7E, and are run by the graduate teaching assistants.
  You will perform the labs in teams.
  Each lab includes a series of questions for you to answer;
  at the end of lab you must turn in your written answers to recieve a grade.
  Make-up labs are not offered.
  If you have to miss lab due to an illness or emergency, contact me before the lab occurs.
  We will attempt to place you in a different session for that lab.</p>
</div>

<hr>
<div>
  <h3>Exams</h3>
  <p>The course has a midterm and a final exam that will be conducted in Goodwin Hall 115.
  The midterm will occur during our regular class time.
  Both the midterm and the final are closed book,
  and you are not allowed to use online resources, tablets, or computers.
  However, you are encouraged to bring up to 2 sheets worth of notes
  (with writing on the front and back of each) for reference during the test.
  You may also bring a graphing calculator.
  </p>
</div>

<hr>
<div>
  <h3>Teamwork</h3>
  <p>Group discussion and collaborative work is encouraged
  on the homework, labs, and when studying for exams.
  However, you must submit your own assignment.
  All assignments submitted are considered graded work and are subject to the Honor Code.
  Students are not allowed to collaborate during the exams.</p>
</div>

<hr>
<div>
  <h3>Services for Students with Disabilities</h3>
  <p>
  Every student in this course should have an equal opportunity to succeed.
  If you anticipate or experience academic barriers that may be due to disability,
  including but not limited to ADHD, chronic or temporary medical conditions, deaf or hard of hearing, learning disability, mental health, or vision impairment,
  please contact the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office (540-231-3788, ssd@vt.edu, or visit <a class="link" href="https://www.ssd.vt.edu/">www.ssd.vt.edu</a>).
  If you have an SSD accommodation letter, please email me as soon as possible so that I can accommodate your needs.
  I am happy to discuss your accommodations in a private meeting during office hours (or by appointment).
  </p>
</div>

<hr>
<div>
  <h3>Honor Code</h3>
  <p>
  The Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to
  abide by states:</p>
  <p><i>“As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
  steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.”</i></p>
  <p>Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who
  has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining
  specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation.
  Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the
  requirements and expectations of the Honor Code. Academic integrity expectations are the same
  for online classes as they are for in person classes. All university policies and procedures apply
  in any Virginia Tech academic environment.
  For additional information about the Honor Code, please visit: <a class="link" href="https://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/">https://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/</a>
  </p>
</div>

<hr>
<div>
  <h3>Honor Code Pledge</h3>
  <p>The Virginia Tech honor code pledge for assignments is as follows:</p>
  <p><i>``I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this assignment.''</i></p>
  <p>
    The pledge is to be written out on all graded assignments at the university and signed by the student.
    The honor pledge represents both an expression of the student's support of the honor code and a commitment to uphold the academic standards at Virginia Tech.
  </p>
</div>

<hr>
<div>
  <h3>Academic Misconduct</h3>
  <p>
  If you have questions or are unclear about what constitutes academic
  misconduct on an assignment or exam, please speak with me.
  The normal sanction I will recommend for a violation of the Honor Code
  is an F* sanction as your final course grade. The
  F represents failure in the course, and * identifies a student
  who has failed to uphold the values of academic integrity at Virginia Tech.
  </p>
